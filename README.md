#  Seaborn Visualization Repository

Welcome to my **Seaborn** repository!  
This Repository focuses on learning and practicing **Seaborn**, a powerful and beautiful data visualization library built on top of **Matplotlib**.

---

## ðŸ“š What is Seaborn?

**Seaborn** is a Python visualization library that makes it **easier** to create **beautiful, attractive, and informative** statistical graphics.  
While **Matplotlib** is powerful but sometimes complicated and basic, **Seaborn** provides:
- **Simpler functions**
- **Better default styles** (such as attractive color palettes and clean layouts)

---

## âœ¨ Key Features of Seaborn

- ðŸŽ¯ Easy to visualize relationships between multiple variables
- ðŸ“ˆ Built-in support for statistical plots (like regression lines)
- ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful default themes and color palettes
- âš¡ Simple functions for common plots like `lineplot`, `scatterplot`, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Major Plot Categories in Seaborn

Seaborn plots are mainly divided into **three categories**:

### 1. Relational Plots
- `scatterplot()`
- `lineplot()`
- `relplot()`

### 2. Categorical Plots
- `barplot()`
- `countplot()`
- `boxplot()`
- `violinplot()`
- `stripplot()`
- `swarmplot()`

### 3. Distribution Plots
- `histplot()`
- `kdeplot()`
- `ecdfplot()`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

You can install Seaborn using pip:

```bash
pip install seaborn
